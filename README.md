A basic webscraper to scrape NSE livestocks data at an interval of 15 minutes. Created using python. Used Selenium and Chromedriver to scrape the data into a .xls file.

### How to run
---
After cloning the repo, do the following steps:-
1. [Download] the chromedriver based on your chrome version. 
   (Currently tested on Version 79.0.3945.130 (Official Build) (64-bit))
2. After extracting the .zip file, change the directory in the webscraper_2.0.py file where chromedriver.exe has been extracted to.
   Alternatively, you can extract the chromedriver to the downloaded directory path of this repo.
   ``` python
       ...
       chrome_path = r"D:\Work\Yash\Webscraper 2.0\chromedriver.exe"  #Change this path accordingly
       driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_path)
    
    ```
3. Finally, run the webscraper_2.0.py!

You'll find a .xls file being created at an interval of 15 minutes.
