1) 2 programs in total --->  One for fetching data whenever it is executed and another program for calculating difference from two different files with input as time range/file name

2) Automate this process of fetching data for a given start time. Ideally, it would end if a) the script is stopped b) There's no change in the data for say,1 hour. (Kinda impossible ,this second case though)


1. #Later O1 (CALL)
2. REALTIME CHANGE IN OI
3. #CHANGE IN OI
3. #LTP (CALL)
4. #NET CHANGE (CALL)
5. DIFF IN NET CHANGE (LATER - PREV)
